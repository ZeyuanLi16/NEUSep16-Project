# NEUSep16-Project

Please check out the Folder src/org/neu/project where We provide the class of Inventory, Dealer, Vehicle for each team to use.

for BrowsingInventory team. We will call the Class Named CustomerBrowsingInventory and DealerBrowsingInventory with passing dealerID(String) to your team. Our suggestion is to create a super class of BrowsingInventory for inheritance so that there is little change needed between the customer view and dealer view.

for Specials team. We will call the Class Named BrowsingSpecials with passing dealerID(String);
