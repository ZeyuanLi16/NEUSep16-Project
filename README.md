# NEUSep16-Project

Please check out the class of DataManager, FileManager and Inventory And Dealer in Group02's File where We provide the interface for every team to use.

for BrowsingInventory team. We will call the Class Named CustomerBrowsingInventory and DealerBrowsingInventory with passing dealerID(String) to your team. Our suggestion is to create a super class of BrowsingInventory for inheritance so that there is little change needed between the customer view and dealer view.

for Specials team. We will call the Class Named BrowsingSpecials with passing dealerID(String);

All the teams can use DateManager object with your own file path to reach out the inventory object which holds the vehicle information.
please see the detals of each class.
